## About Larabelles

Larabelles is a community that focuses on reducing barriers for people who identify as women to enter the world of technology. We do this by encouraging people to consider a career in tech and by providing a safe space to feel welcome and supported, not just at the beginning of their development career, but throughout.

Larabelles aim to make the world of Laravel development more accessible to women, non-binary and trans folk by promoting them, their accomplishments and projects, by providing networking and socialising opportunities, and by sharing resources.

## About Larabelles Joint Project

As a community, we decided to work on a joint project. This project will help us to learn from each other, to work on things we may not have worked before, and to have a Laravel project to share when interviewing.

## About Covid Dashboard project

In this project we are building a dashboard with current Covid-19 information from across the world. We will practise building an API client, data processing, data visualisation and cache management.

This section will be updated as we plan this project.
